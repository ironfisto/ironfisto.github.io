The article "Bypassing Facebook Prohibit Embedding Feature for Public Video" by Mukul Lohar describes a method to embed public Facebook videos on third-party websites, even when the "prohibit embedding" option is enabled. The author used a specific HTML iframe code snippet, replacing `{Video_id}` with the target video's ID, to bypass this restriction. The bug was reported on January 27, 2017, acknowledged the next day, patched on March 8, 2017, and a bounty was awarded on March 16, 2017.
