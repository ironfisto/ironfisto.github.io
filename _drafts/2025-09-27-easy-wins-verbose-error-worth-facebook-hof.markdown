The article describes how Mukul Lohar found a verbose error vulnerability in Facebook, earning him a spot in the Facebook Hall of Fame 2020. He used `waybackurls` to extract Facebook URLs and focused on those with an `app_id` parameter. By testing a specific sharing endpoint and using the "feeling/activity" feature, he discovered that sharing an activity as a story leaked file names and paths. This bug was reported and accepted by Facebook security.
